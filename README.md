# Metro-Route-Planner
The "Metro Route Optimization Program" project involves the creation of a C++ application designed to determine the shortest route between metro stations. By leveraging various algorithms including Dijkstra, breadth-first search, and depth-first search, this program provides users with optimized travel routes. Implementation is executed using Graph and Heap Data Structures, where nodes represent metro stations and edges correspond to distances. The project aims to enhance public transportation efficiency by offering efficient and accurate routing options.
